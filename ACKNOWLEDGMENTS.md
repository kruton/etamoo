Acknowledgments
===============

EtaMOO follows a long history of MUD tradition involving many people who are
or have been influential to me. This is an attempt to acknowledge some of
these people and their contributions, with my gratitude...

  * __RÃ©my Evard__ was a valued mentor and friend without whose influence I
    probably would never have gotten as involved with MOO as I have.

  * __Pavel Curtis__ maintained the original LambdaMOO server code for many
    years long ago, and was kind enough to exchange some ideas with me as I
    was writing LPMOO, my first re-implementation of MOO. His thorough
    documentation of LambdaMOO (later also by __Erik Ostrom__ and __Roger
    Crew__) in the form of the _LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual_ has been an
    invaluable technical resource without which I doubt projects such as LPMOO
    or EtaMOO would have seemed feasible.

  * __Felix Croes__ created DGD, the platform on which I made LPMOO. Not only
    is he an inspiration to me in writing excellent code, I believe he was the
    first person to introduce the idea of software transactional memory to me.

  * __Jay Carlson__ was a maintainer of the LambdaMOO server code some time
    ago and has often provided valuable insights and supportive feedback on a
    wide range of subjects.

  * __Ken Fox__ has been a friend, advocate, and developer extraordinaire for
    many years, and his contributions to the MOO community -- particularly in
    building and enhancing various databases -- are greatly appreciated.

  * __Ben Jackson__ wrote the original WAIF datatype patches for the LambdaMOO
    server upon which I based the WAIF implementation for EtaMOO.

  * __Kenny Root__ and __James Deikun__ were effective collaborators with me
    in the creation of Codepoint, a fork of LambdaMOO (based on the initial
    work of __H. Peter Anvin__) to support Unicode.

  * __Dylan Simon__ provided several useful suggestions and feedback on this
    Haskell implementation of EtaMOO.

  * __Konsta Ranta__ provided early feedback and helpfully reported erroneous
    behavior during EtaMOO development.
